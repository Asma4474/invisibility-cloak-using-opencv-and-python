# invisibility-cloak-using-opencv-and-python
this project was done on opencv.for best results use a monochrome cloth
the lighting contributes to the color changes,hence be careful while setting the hsv values
make sure the red values are such tht it doesn not detect your skin as well
if you are new to opencv you can always learn them from https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html
if you want to try for different colors just change the hsv values.
thats it.follow the code and take the above mentioned details into consideration and you have an invisibility code to yourself!
